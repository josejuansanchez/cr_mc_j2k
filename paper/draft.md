## Client-driven Transmission of JPEG2000 Image Sequences using Motion Compensated Conditional Replenishment

### Note

A [wiki is available](https://github.com/josejuansanchez/cr_mc_j2k/wiki) with
relevant information related with the work in progress.

### Abstract

This is a work in progress in the context of remote browsing of JPEG2000
image sequences that takes advantage of the spatial scalability of JPEG2000
to determine which precincts of a next image should be transmitted and what
precincts should be reused from a reconstructed image previously.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with and without motion compensation
and using a transmission exclusively controlled by the client, the
reconstructions are consistently improved, both visually and from a 
rate-distortion point of view.
