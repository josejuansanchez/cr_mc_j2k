Interactive Streaming of Sequences of High Resolution JPEG2000 Images

This work presents the Continue data-flow control strategy,
a JPIP-compliant solution for the interactive streaming of sequences
of images that are transmitted over time-varying communication
channels. In this context, the random fluctuation of the capacity of
the transmission channel over the time forces the clients to
prefetch a minimal amount of the code-stream of each image of the
beginning of the transmitted sequence before the playback starts,
and the server to decide, in real-time, which amount of the
code-stream of each compressed image is going to be transmitted. The
estimated channel capacity is performed by clients and the
rate-control at the server is straightforward, resulting in a highly
scalable image retrieval system.

Client-driven Transmission of JPEG2000 Image Sequences using Motion Compensated Conditional Replenishment

This is a work in progress in the context of remote browsing of JPEG2000 image
sequences that takes advantage of the spatial scalability of JPEG2000 to
determine which precincts of a next image should be transmitted and what
precincts should be reused from a reconstructed image previously. Experimental
results demonstrate that, with and without motion compensation and using a
transmission exclusively controlled by the client, the reconstructions are
consistently improved, both visually and from a rate-distortion point of view.
