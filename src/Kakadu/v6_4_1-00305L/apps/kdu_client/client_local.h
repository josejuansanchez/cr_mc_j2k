         2) Tdat = the time between the receipt of the reply text and the
         end of the response data belonging to that reply.  The object
         adaptively adjusts its suggested request byte limit so that
                   Tgap / (Tdat+Tgap) \approx (Tdat+Tgap) / 10 seconds.

         increased, unless the request size was already so large that the
         server pre-empted the last part of the request, reducing the
         response length substantially below the suggested byte limit.
         Evidently, the algorithm will not push Tdat+Tgap beyond 10 seconds.
           * If Tgap / (Tdat+Tgap) < (Tdat+Tgap)/10, the request size is
         decreased, unless Tdat+Tgap is already less than 1 second, in

  /* Notes:
        This object represents a single HTTP transport, for issuing requests
     and receiving replies and or response data.  Each JPIP channel
     (represented by a `kdc_cid' object) uses a single primary HTTP channel
     (i.e., a single `kdc_primary' object).
        Each JPIP channel which uses the HTTP-only transport has its own
     primary channel.  However, HTTP-TCP transported JPIP channels share
     a common HTTP channel wherever possible.
        The `active_requester' member, if non-NULL, points to the request
     queue associated with a currently scheduled request.  This pointer
     remains valid at least until the request has been delivered over the
     HTTP channel.  For HTTP-only transported CID's, the `active_requester'
     member remains non-NULL until the reply is actually received.  For
     HTTP-TCP transported CID's, the `active_requester' member can become
     NULL as soon as the request has been delivered.  The `active_requester'
     member blocks new requests from being delivered, so we sometimes leave
     it non-NULL for longer so as to temporarily prevent unwanted request
     interleaving.  For a new request queue (one with
     `kdc_request_queue::just_started'=true) we always leave the queue as
     the active requester until the reply is received, which allows
     persistence to be determined and also allows for the fact that the
     first reply may assign a new CID for the queue whose transport type
     could affect the policy described above.  If the channel turns out to
     be non-persistent, we leave the `active_requester' non-NULL
     until the HTTP response (reply and any response data) are received.  We
     do the same thing for stateless communications (i.e., where there is no
     channel-ID), since we cannot formulate a comprehensive set of cache
     model statements until we have received all outstanding data.  Of course,
     this makes stateless communication less responsive, but that is why
     JPIP is designed with stateful sessions in mind.
        `first_active_cid' points to a list of all CID's which are or have
     been the `active_requester', but for which the reply (including HTTP
     response data for HTTP-only CID's) is still outstanding.  This means
     that as soon as a CID supplies a valid request, its active request queue
     becomes the `active_requester' and the CID itself is appended to the
     tail of the active CID list (identified by `last_active_cid').  If a
     CID issues multiple requests consecutively, for which there are multiple
     outstanding replies, that CID's replies (and responses, if
     HTTP-transported) must all be cleared before we can advance the list.
        For HTTP-only communications, there is only one CID associated with
     any given primary transport channel.  For HTTP-only communications,
     the `flow_regulator' is also used to estimate the channel/server
     behaviour and to generate reasonable length limits to apply to outgoing
     requests, so that the primary HTTP transport does not become clogged with
     the responses to past requests, damaging responsiveness to new requests
     which may need to pre-empt existing ones.  The `flow_regulator'
     expects us to use the policy of not sending new requests until at least
     the reply to a past request has been received.  This is why we leave
     `active_requester' non-NULL until the point at which the reply has been
     received.  Once it becomes non-NULL, a new request can be scheduled.
        For HTTP-TCP communications, the `flow_regulator' is not used and
     the server manages flow control.  For this reason, we allow new requests
     from different CID's to be dispatched before existing requests have even
     been replied.  In the process, the active CID's list may grow to
     represent the CID's for which requests have been delivered but replies
     have not yet been received.  No CID may appear in multiple
     locations on the list of active CID's, so a CID may not pre-empt
     its own requests while other CID's are still waiting to send their
     requests ... in practice, this should not be much of a limitation,
     since the server is unlikely to be able to de-interleave pre-empting
     requests from later in the TCP request pipe while there are
     outstanding requests to be processed from other CID's, earlier in the
     pipe.

  /* Notes:
        CID objects are used to represent JPIP channels (the name comes from
     the fact that JPIP channels are identified by a `cid' query field in
     the JPIP request syntax).  There is exactly one CID for each channel
     assigned by the server, but for stateless communications, we use a
     single `kdc_cid' object with a NULL `channel_id' member.  All JPIP
     communication starts stateless, but may become stateful if the server
     grants a `cnew' request, in which case the `channel_id' member becomes
     non-NULL and stores the server-assigned unique Channel-ID.
        All CID's are associated with a primary HTTP transport, over which
     requests are delivered and replies received.  As already discussed under
     `kdc_primary', HTTP-only CID's (those where `uses_aux_channel' is false)
     each have their own primary HTTP channel (i.e., `primary_channel' points
     to a unique channel for each such CID).  HTTP-TCP transported CID's,
     however, have use the `aux_channel' to receive response data.  These
     CID's share a common primary HTTP transport wherever they can (i.e.,
     wherever the IP address and port assigned for the primary HTTP
     communications by the server are consistent), so as to conserve
     resources.  There are no real efficiency benefits to separating the
     HTTP channels used by HTTP-TCP transported JPIP channels.
        The `first_active_receiver' and `last_active_receiver' members manage
     a list of all request queues which have at least begun to issue a
     request, but have not yet received all replies and response data to
     their outstanding requests.  A request queue may appear on this list
     only once, so it is not possible for a request queue to issue a new
     request if it is already in any position on this list other than the
     tail.  This principle is embodied in the implementation of the
     `find_next_requester' function.
        The `last_requester' member points to the request queue which most
     recently issued a request.  This member is set by the
     `kdc_request_queue::issue_request' function, which also appends the
     requester to the end of the active receiver list.
        The `newly_assigned_by_server' flag is true if this CID was created
     in response to a JPIP-cnew response from the server.  In this case,
     communication over the new CID proceeds using the primary channel on
     which the JPIP-cnew response was received, but only for the request.  No
     new requests are accepted over the CID until the primary channel
     connection details can be verified (possibly reassigned), which takes
     place when the CID is first removed as the active-CID on its original
     primary channel.  The `kdc_primary::remove_active_cid' watches out for
     this condition and calls `assign_ongoing_primary_channel'.

         terminated, for one reason or another.  Accordingly,
         `req->reply_received' and `req->response_terminated' must be true.
            The function advances `first_incomplete', discards all but
         the first complete response from the request queue (we always try
         to keep one around to see if new requests are redundant or not),
         and potentially adjusts the `is_idle' and `status_string' members.

         are made redundant by the new completed request, removing them
         if required -- except that the final request of a queue, whose
         `close_when_idle' flag is set, is never removed (this is the one
         on which the "cclose" message is sent).
            If this was a stateless request, the function updates the set
         of model managers, so that there is one for each code-stream for
         which we have received a main header. */
    void issue_request();

             Moreover, the function should not be called until
         `cid->newly_assigned_by_server' is false, since we should not be
         issuing new requests over a CID until its primary
         connection details have been validated and/or reassigned.
            The function also takes responsibility for adding the queue onto
         its CID's active-receiver list, if it is not already there, since
         a queue must enter the active receiver list from the moment that
         a request is first commenced, even if it takes a while to go out
         through the relevant TCP channel.
            If this function issues a request over a CID which already has an
         incomplete request from one or more other request queues (i.e.,
         request queues other than the current one, which are on the CID's
         active receiver list) and the current request is preemptive, it is
         likely to pre-empt these other request queues.  To conceal this
         from the application, the present function synthesizes a copy of
         each such potentially pre-empted request.  A copy is made if the
         potentially pre-empted request is the final one on its queue or
         if the ensuing request is non-preemptive.  Request copies have
         the same pre-emptability as the source request from which they
         are copied.  Moreover, when a request is duplicated, it is marked
         as having been duplicated so that no attempt is made to duplicate
         it again, either here or inside the `kdc_primary::read_body_chunk'
         function.
            The function does not actually send the request, mainly because
         this might generate an exception that could be hard to back out of
         without killing the entire client connection.  Instead, the
         caller should later scan the primary request channels, looking for
         any which have `kdc_primary::active_requester' non-NULL and
         `kdc_primary::send_block' non-empty, invoking the corresponding
         `kdc_primary::send_active_request' funcion if so.  It is easier
         to catch network-generated exceptions at that point.  If the
         request needs to be re-sent due to channel queue fulness or
         anything like that, it will happen automatically from within
         the `kdc_primary::service_channel' function which is invoked by

         the reply headers, using them to adjust the state of the
         `first_unreplied' entry on the request queue and returning a
         pointer to this entry.  When the function returns non-NULL, the
