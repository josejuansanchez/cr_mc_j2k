<A name="Introduction"></A>
<h1 class="section">Introduction</h1>
<p>
   This brief document is designed to accompany the two demonstration
   viewers/browsers which come with Kakadu. Internally, these viewers are named
   "kdu_winshow" and "kdu_macshow", but the executables are both known as
   "kdu_show" on their respective operating systems. All source code to each of
   these tools is provided with licensed copies of Kakadu and may be used to aid
   in the construction of even more elaborate applications. However, both viewers
   already possess a very full list of features.
</p>
<p>
   As of Kakadu version 6.2, the two viewers offer almost identical functionality
   and pretty much identical menu options and accelerators -- except that the CMD
   key is used in place of CTRL for many of the Mac accelerators, in keeping with
   convention. The source code for both viewers is also very close, with most
   files and objects having identical names for "kdu_winshow" and "kdu_macshow"
   except that the former are prefixed by "<em>kdws_</em>" while the latter are
   prefixed by "<em>kdms_</em>". These viewers are implemented on top of powerful
   platform-independent Kakadu API's, such as `<em>kdu_region_compositor</em>',
   `<em>jpx_source</em>', `<em>mj2_source</em>' and the like.
</p>
<p>
   Briefly, these viewers include the following features:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <p>
         Highly efficient viewing of arbitrarily large images, image compositions, and
         videos on the local file system, with zoom, pan, rotate, etc.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Highly efficient remote viewing of large images and image compositions via the
         JPIP interactive communication protocol -- remote browsing of video is not yet
         enabled.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Ability to review and describe all codestream parameter attributes associated
         with compressed content.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Ability to open multiple windows at once, to the same or different image
         sources, whether locally or remotely located -- a convenient window
         duplication function makes it very simple to open a new window into a current
         region of interest. When used with JPIP remote browsing, the data received
         from the server is shared by all relevant windows and advanced multiple
         JPIP channel features are exploited wherever available, for maximum
         efficiency.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Ability to display the metadata file structure associated with any JP2-family
         source (JP2, JPX, MJ2).
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Metadata catalog side-bar for JP2/JPX files allows efficient navigation
         through richly annotated images, using both imagery and metadata information
         to drive the navigation -- works beautifully with JPIP remote image browsing
         as well.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Metadata editor, capable of providing rich annotation information to be saved
         in the JPX file format.
      </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="section">Basic Operations</h1>
<h2 class="subsection">Opening and Closing Files</h2>
<p>
   The File menu may be used to open and close files. Alternatively, you may find
   the "ctrl-o" (Mac: "cmd-o") accelerator key useful for opening files quickly.
   Opening a new file automatically closes any existing open file. You can supply
   the name of a file to "<em>kdu_show</em>" on the command line, in which case
   that file will be opened on start up and its dimensions will guide the initial
   size of the view window.
</p>
<p>
   The "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool can open JP2 files, JPX files, unwrapped JPEG2000
   codestreams and even Motion JPEG2000 (MJ2) video files.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Panning, Zooming and Re-orienting</h2>
<p>
   The "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool started out as a sophisticated demonstration
   application to showcase some of Kakadu's capabilities for incremental
   decompression of large images, based on spatial regions of interest (view
   ports), as well as Kakadu's ability to decompress images in a geometrically
   transformed domain. In fact, Kakadu's codestream management architecture has
   always allowed compressed JPEG2000 images to be accessed as though they had
   been compressed as smaller image, rotated and/or cropped versions of
   themselves. As a result, the core "<em>kdu_show</em>" features have always
   been those of panning, zooming, rotating and flipping a viewport into the
   compressed image.
</p>
<p>
   Panning may be accomplished via the scroll-bars, or using the arrow keys. The
   image may also be dragged around with the mouse while the left mouse button is
   depressed and the shift key held down.
</p>
<p>
   Zooming may be accomplished via the View menu or with the "Z" (zoom in) and
   "ctrl-Z" (zoom out) accelerators. By default, zooming is centred about the
   middle of the current viewport, but you may define an alternate focus box
   using the method described below. Zooming out is accomplished using the
   multi-resolution attributes of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). As such,
   the degree to which you can zoom out is limited by the number of DWT levels
   created when the image was compressed. Although this limit could readily be
   circumvented by rescaling the decompressed image, it provides useful feedback
   to content creators, making them aware of the limitations associated with
   using too few DWT levels.
</p>
<p>
   Rotation and flipping may be accomplished via the View menu or with the "[",
   "]", "_" and "\" accelerators. Note, however, that any rotation which involves
   image transposition (not just horizontal and vertical flipping) may slightly
   alter the displayed imagery if it happens to have been compressed using
   JPEG2000's reversible processing path (Kakadu's "Creversible=yes" attribute).
   The reason for this is that horizontal and vertical aspects of the wavelet
   transform do not completely commute when the reversible transform is used, due
   to LSB rounding effects. Kakadu accomplishes rotation by decompressing the
   imagery in a reverse order and performing the wavelet transform in an
   alternate order, rather than just decompressing the image and then
   subsequently reorienting it.
</p>
<p>
   The application automatically resizes its window to match the image size,
   unless the image is too large to be viewed in the current window, in which
   case a restricted viewport is displayed. You may adjust the window size via
   the usual resize handles. Alternatively, and often more conveniently, you may
   enlarge or shrink the view window quickly using the "W" and "S" accelerator
   keys.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Special note on zooming: </strong>JPX files can contain compositions
   of codestream imagery, where each composed piece has arbitrary scale factors.
   The "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool handles such imagery correctly, regardless of the
   implied scaling factors, but there can be no one global scaling factor which
   results in optimal rendering of the entire composition. Also, the policy in
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" is to keep the global scaling factor constant as you
   navigate to different compositing layers and/or composited frames. As a
   result, you may find that the scaling factor applied to a particular
   codestream image component of interest is not ideal. Ideal scaling factors are
   integer expansion factors and power of 2 decimation factors. Whenever you use
   the "z" (zoom in) and "ctrl-z" (zoom out) function, the zoom factor is
   automatically adjusted to one which is ideal for the top-most or dominant
   imagery found within the view window or focus box (see below). However, you
   may also find the "alt-z" (optimize zoom) function very useful. It makes the
   smallest possible change to the current global scaling factor so as to
   optimally render the content which is dominant within the view window or the
   focus box (see below). Keep this function in mind when browsing complex JPX
   content.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Special note on zooming vs. display scaling:</strong> The
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool also provides you with a special "<em>Scale X2</em>"
   feature, which may be accessed via the View menu. While this may seem very
   similar to zooming, there is an important distinction. The "<em>Scale X2</em>"
   feature (accelerator key "X") causes each rendered image pixel to be displayed
   using a 2x2 block of display pixels, regardless of the current zoom setting.
   For example, zooming out from the image (so that it is being rendered at 50%
   resolution) causes the highest frequency subbands and the last stage of DWT
   synthesis to be dropped from the compressed imagery. With the "<em>Scale
   X2</em>" you can visualize the resulting imagery more clearly, especially on
   displays with very small pixels. When zooming in beyond 100% resolution, the
   "<em>Scale X2</em>" essentially just gives you another factor of 2 in zoom,
   but it allows the operating system to use GPU resources to do the scaling,
   which can result in faster rendering of zoomed imagery to the display.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Focus Boxes</h2>
<p>
   Focus boxes have at least 3 uses in "<em>kdu_show</em>": 1) they define a
   centre for zooming; 2) they define the region of interest during remote image
   browsing with JPIP (see Section <span class="ref">sec<sub>j</sub>pip</span>);
   and 3) they define spatial regions to be associated with metadata added using
   the methods described in Section
   <span class="ref">sec<sub>m</sub>etadata</span>.
</p>
<p>
   To define a focus box, hold the left mouse button down while dragging the
   mouse to define the region of interest. If you change your mind after
   depressing the mouse button, you may hit the escape key to cancel the focus
   box being defined, without affecting any pre-existing focus box.
</p>
<p>
   To remove a focus box, you may: 1) use the Focus menu; or 2) hit the "F"
   accelerator key.
</p>
<p>
   By default, the focus box will be displayed using both a highlighting
   technique and a dashed outline. The highlighting technique makes the rest of
   the image slightly darker, and the focus box slightly lighter. You can turn
   off the highlighting by using the Focus menu, or hitting the "H" accelerator
   key.
</p>
<p>
   You can widen or shrink an existing focus box using the Focus menu, or the
   "shift-W" and "shift-S" accelerators.
</p>
<p>
   You can pan the focus box using the arrow keys, while holding down the shift
   key. Basically, the accelerators which affect the focus box are identical to
   those used to manipulate the view window, except that the shift key is held
   down.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Quality Layers</h2>
<p>
   JPEG2000 codestreams may contain multiple embedded image qualities, which form
   the foundation of quality progressive remote image browsing. By default, local
   files are opened at maximum quality, but it can be useful to see the visual
   quality associated with each compressed quality layer. To reduce the number of
   quality layers you may use the View menu or the "&lt;" accelerator. You may
   increase the quality again using the View menu or the "&gt;" accelerator.
   These manipulations automatically change the status bar to one which displays
   the number of quality layers which are in use.
</p>
<p>
   When playing video content, you may well find that displaying all of the
   available quality layers is too slow. Reducing the quality typically increases
   rendering speed dramatically, especially when the original content was
   losslessly compressed. Of course, this is only possible if multiple quality
   layers are available in the source content.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Navigating Between Image Elements</h2>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>n</sub>avigating"></a>
</p>
<p>
   The "kdu_show" tool has 3 fundamental modes of image display, as follows:
</p>
<dl class="description">
   <dt class="leadin">Single Component Mode:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         In this mode, only a single image component is displayed as a greyscale image.
         Image components typically correspond to colour channels (e.g., red, green,
         blue, or luminance, and chrominance channels), but they may correspond to
         alpha blending channels, palette indices, or anything else.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         To enter single component mode, use the View/Navigate menu or hit either of
         the "1" or "+" accelerator keys. While in this mode, you may navigate forward
         and backward within the image components of a given codestream by using the
         View menu or the "+" and "-" accelerators.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         While in single component mode, you may navigate amongst the codestreams in
         the file (JPX and MJ2 files may have any number of codestreams) using the
         RETURN and BACKSPACE keys. Alternatively, you may use the View menu.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Single Compositing Layer Mode:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         In this mode, only one compositing layer is displayed, usually as a colour
         image, or alpha blended against a solid white background. A JP2 file contains
         exactly one compositing layer, which is the rendered colour image. A JPX file
         may contain any number of compositing layers. A raw codestream is treated as
         having exactly one compositing layer, corresponding to our best guess
         regarding the intended display image.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         A Motion JPEG2000 (MJ2) file may contain one or more video tracks, each of
         which is treated as a compositing layer. This is sensible since MJ2 tracks can
         be composed onto a richer surface in the same way that JPX compositing layers
         can be composed. The fundamental difference between MJ2 video tracks as
         compositing layers and JPX compositing layers is that the former typically
         involves multiple images (video frames), all with the same dimensions, whereas
         the latter involves only a single image.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         To enter single compositing layer mode, use the View/Navigate menu or hit the
         "L" accelerator key. While in this mode, you may navigate forward and backward
         amongst JPX compositing layers or amongst frames of a current MJ2 video track,
         by using the RETURN and BACKSPACE keys or the View menu. To move to a
         different MJ2 video track, use the View menu.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Composited Image Mode:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         In this mode, the application displays what it believes to be the intended
         image. For JP2 files and unwrapped raw codestreams, this is identical to the
         result displayed in single compositing layer mode. If a JPX file contains a
         composition box, however, the composition instructions are used to build the
         composited image which was intended by the content creator. For MJ2 files,
         this mode is currently equivalent to single compositing layer mode, so you can
         only view one video track at a time. However, this is a limitation only of the
         "<em>kdu_show</em>" demo application; the underlying
         `<em>kdu_region_compositor</em>' object, which does all the rendering work,
         fully supports composed video.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         When a new file is opened, "<em>kdu_show</em>" starts out in the composited
         image mode, but if you have changed the mode to single component or single
         compositing layer mode, you may get back to composited image mode by using the
         View menu or hitting the "C" accelerator.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         While in composited image mode, you may navigate forward and backward between
         composited frames (animations contain multiple frames, each of which is a
         composited image) by using the RETURN and BACKSPACE keys, or via the
         View/Navigate menu.
      </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<A name="Status Information"></A>
<h1 class="section">Status Information</h1>
<p>
   Some summary information is displayed at the bottom of the application window
   on its status bar. The status bar is divided into fields. The information
   displayed in these fields also depends upon the status mode, which may be
   toggled using the Status menu, or via the "ctrl-T" (Mac: "cmd-T") accelerator
   key. In particular, you can currently toggle between the following status
   modes:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left field displays current zoom factor (percent); centre field displays
         current image element; right field displays number of quality layers. The
         interpretations of these quantities are as given above for the Windows viewer.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left and centre fields as above; right field displays the full size of the
         image at the current resolution, measured in pixels -- i.e., exactly the same
         as the Windows viewer.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left and centre fields as above (current zoom factor and image element); right
         field displays the amount of working memory used by the codestream management
         machinery (for all codestreams currently loaded into memory). As described for
         the Windows viewer, this value is generally very small if the codestreams are
         enabled for random access (precincts, PLT marker segments and a layer-minor
         progression order).
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         (Available during remote image browsing via JPIP) Left field displays the JPIP
         client status (e.g., "connecting", "receiving ...", "disconnected"); centre
         field as above; right field displays communication information, such as
         current data rate and total received data.
      </p>
</li>
</ol>

<A name="Remote Image Browsing with JPIP"></A>
<h1 class="section">Remote Image Browsing with JPIP</h1>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>j</sub>pip"></a>
</p>
<p>
   By and large, images may be accessed remotely from a JPIP server (such as that
   implemented by the "<em>kdu_server</em>" utility) exactly as if they were
   local files. Rather than experiencing significant delays while the image
   downloads, you will instead observe incrementally improving quality as image
   data is incrementally transferred by the server. JPIP servers focus the
   transmitted data around the region defined by the focus window so the quality
   in that region increases more rapidly. If no focus window is defined, it is
   taken to be the current view window. Once sufficient data has been received to
   reconstruct the image within the focus window without loss, at the current
   display resolution, the server enters the idle mode and will not transmit any
   further data until the image region, resolution (zoom factor), codestream,
   image components, compositing layer or animation frame are changed.
</p>
<p>
   It is important to realize that the viewing tool is only loosely
   (asynchronously) coupled to the client component and, ultimately, to the
   server utility. You are always free to pan, zoom and otherwise navigate the
   display to any part of the image, regardless of whether any data has been
   received from the server to render that region. After some time, the server
   will adjust its transmission pattern to serve the new image region/resolution
   which is currently of interest. Of course, if the server has disconnected, no
   amount of navigation will bring in new data, so you will generally be left
   with non-uniform image quality which reflects the amount of time spent
   browsing in different image regions.
</p>
<p>
   It is also important to realize that the JPIP server is allowed to shrink the
   region of the image for which it will serve data, if the region is too large
   to be served in a quality progressive fashion without consuming excessive
   server memory resources. If this happens, the changed region will be reflected
   on the view window through a new focus box. You may move this modified focus
   box around, to change the region to which the server's transmission is
   customized, but you may not enlarge the focus box without having the server
   force it back down again to its size limit.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Regular Image Browsing</h2>
<p>
   To open a remote image, use the "File-&gt;Open JPIP URL" menu item ("ctrl-U"
   or "cmd-U" accelerators), or start "<em>kdu_show</em>" with an appropriate URL
   on the command line. The URL dialog box provides several fields for you to
   fill out. For regular image browsing, enter the name of the file you want to
   access in the "<em>Resource or request string</em>" field and enter the name
   or IP address of the server machine in the "<em>Server</em>" field. You may
   append an optional colon-separated port number to the server name or address,
   if your server is not listening on the default port 80.
</p>
<p>
   One of three closely related JPIP transfer protocols may be selected via the
   "<em>Transport protocol</em>" drop-down list. For the most efficient
   communication, the "<em>http-tcp</em>" option is recommended; however, this
   requires the establishment of both an HTTP and a regular TCP channel, which
   might not be permitted by some institutional firewalls. In this case, select
   "<em>http</em>" as the next best option. The "<em>none</em>" option is
   primarily for experimental purposes. It is much less efficient, especially for
   the server.
</p>
<p>
   If your organization requires all external traffic to flow through an HTTP
   proxy, select the "<em>http</em>" option and put the name or address of your
   HTTP proxy server in the "<em>Proxy server</em>" field -- you may need to
   consult your system administrator to find out the name of your HTTP proxy.
   Proxies reduce the communication efficiency and responsiveness, so use them
   only if necessary.
</p>
<p>
   You may elect to have all your image browsing results saved in a local cache
   directory, by entering the name of this directory into the "<em>Cache
   directory</em>" field. The advantage of this is that when you open the same
   image again on the same server, or a compatible server (one which assigns the
   same unique target identifier to the image resource), the previous browsing
   results will be reused and that data will not be sent over again by the
   server.
</p>
<p>
   An alternate way to open an image on a remote JPIP server is to supply the URL
   on the command line. The URL must commence with either "<em>http://</em>" or
   "<em>jpip://</em>" as the protocol identifier prefix, followed by the server
   host name (or IP address), a single "/" character, and then the resource
   string. The syntax for the resource string and the server name are identical
   to those used by the URL dialog box. The alternate "<em>jpip://</em>" protocol
   identifier is provided so that the "<em>kdu_show</em>" utility can be fired up
   automatically from a web browser whenever a URL with this protocol identifier
   is encountered. In fact "<em>kdu_show</em>" registers itself with the Windows
   Internet Explorer (Safari on the Mac) as the target for such URL's, the first
   time it is ever used. You should be aware that when URLs are supplied on the
   command line, "<em>kdu_show</em>" obtains the remaining information (proxy
   server, cache directory, protocol variant) from persistent preference
   information, based on the last values supplied via the URL dialog. For this
   reason, it is advisable to use this dialog to configure the application first,
   before opening URLs from the command line or by clicking on JPIP URLs on a web
   page.
</p>
<p>
   You may explicitly disconnect from a JPIP server, without actually closing the
   image, by using the "File-&gt;Disconnect JPIP request queue" menu item.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">One-Shot Image Browsing</h2>
<p>
   To implement the functionality of an image browser, "<em>kdu_show</em>" uses
   Kakadu's `<em>kdu_client</em>' object to generate a sequence of much more
   complex HTTP requests than that supplied via a typical command line URL. These
   much richer requests are generated using either HTTP POST or HTTP GET with
   query parameters appended to the URL, separated by the usual "?" query
   separator.
</p>
<p>
   You may supply any of these more complicated URLs directly by including the
   "?" query separator and the query fields of interest on the command line or in
   the URL dialog. When you do so, ongoing communications will either be
   interactive or non-interactive, depending on whether you check the "Force
   interactive" box in the URL dialog. If the box is left unchecked, only the
   supplied request will be delivered to the server and no amount of interactive
   navigation within the image will cause any further requests to be sent to the
   server. The server will continue to transmit data relevant to the original
   request until all relevant information has been sent or the server times out
   or is disconnected. As a result, interactive navigation and image data
   delivery are entirely disconnected processes; you may be receiving data
   relevant to a small image region at high resolution, but be viewing the image
   at low resolution (zoom factor) or vice-versa. You may even be viewing a
   completely different codestream within the data source and so not see the
   effects of newly arrived image data.
</p>
<p>
   The main purpose of this mode of behaviour is for server debugging.
</p>
<p>
   To use single shot URLs (or to provide any explicit query options in the
   "Resource or request string" field of the URL dialog), you will need to be
   familiar with the JPIP syntax. It is not the purpose of this document to
   describe this syntax, but the JPIP committee draft may be downloaded from
   "http://www.jpeg.org/CDs15444.html." You may also examine the JPIP requests
   delivered to the Kakadu server during normal interactive image browsing by
   supplying the `<code class="tt">-record</code>' command line option to
   "<em>kdu_server</em>". Note that the request fields you enter into a URL
   dialog box may be hex-hex encoded for robust transport to the server, meaning
   that some characters may be converted to strings of the form "%DD", where D is
   a hexadecimal digit.

<A name="Properties, Metadata, Overlays and Editing"></A>
<h1 class="section">Properties, Metadata, Overlays and Editing</h1>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>m</sub>etadata"></a>
</p>
<p>
   You may use "<em>kdu_show</em>" to view the coding parameter attributes and
   other properties of the codestream (or codestreams). You can also display, add
   and edit metadata in a JP2 or JPX file, resaving edited metadata in the JPX
   format -- only a limited subset of metadata can be saved in the more
   restrictive JP2 format. From Kakadu version 6.2, an extremely useful metadata
   catalog appears as a sidebar within the main window associated with any
   JP2/JPX image which contains text labels.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Viewing Codestream Properties</h2>
<p>
   Use the "File-&gt;Properties" menu item or the "ctrl-P" accelerator (Mac:
   "cmd-P") to view the coding attributes and other properties of the current
   codestream. Where more than one codestream is involved in the current image
   display, the application chooses one of them to display its attributes.
   Codestream properties include comment marker segments, coding parameter marker
   segments and tiling attributes.
</p>
<p>
   You may double-click (single click on the MAC) on any attribute to read a
   detailed description of that attribute's interpretation, as provided by the
   Kakadu core system. In the MAC viewer, this detailed description is
   conveniently formatted together with the current values of the parameter
   attribute in question.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Viewing the File Structure with Metashow</h2>
<p>
   Additional attributes are provided by the file format in which codestreams are
   embedded. To examine the file structure itself, use the Metadata menu or the
   "ctrl-M" accelerator (Mac: "cmd-M") to activate the "<em>metashow</em>" tool.
   You may click on various nodes within the metashow tool's tree view (browser
   view on the MAC) to obtain additional details or to have the main window
   navigate to corresponding image elements. For example, clicking
   (double-clicking in the MAC version) on the second compositing layer header
   box will cause the main window to enter single compositing layer mode and
   display the second compositing layer. Similarly, clicking on a contiguous
   codestream box or codestream header box will cause the main application to
   enter single component mode, while clicking on the composition box, if any,
   will cause the application to enter the composited image mode.
</p>
<p>
   Clicking on some leaf nodes in the metadata tree will cause their contents to
   be expanded as text, while for other boxes a generic hex dump is provided.
</p>
<p>
   The Mac version of "<em>metashow</em>" tool provides you with a number of
   additional features. If you select a metadata item which corresponds to an
   editable JP2/JPX metadata node, the "<em>Open in Metadata Editor</em>" button
   will be activated, allowing you to edit the node, add descendants, etc.
   Although edited metadata does not become part of the file structure until the
   file is saved and reloaded, both Mac and Windows versions of "
   <em>metashow</em>" use strike-through and text colouring conventions to
   highlight elements in the file structure which have been deleted or changed by
   the editor.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Adding New Metadata</h2>
<p>
   To add metadata use the Metadata menu or the "ctrl-A" (Mac: "cmd-A"
   ) accelerator. This opens up the metadata editing dialog, which allows you to
   enter text labels or to import externally edited label or XML box contents. If
   no focus box has been selected, the metadata will be associated by default
   with the top-most current image entity (compositing layer or codestream),
   depending on the current image display mode (see Section
   <span class="ref">sec<sub>n</sub>avigating</span>).
</p>
<p>
   If a focus box was defined at the time when you hit the "ctrl-A" (resp.
   "cmd-A") accelerator, the metadata will be associated by default with the
   top-most codestream which overlaps with the focus region; it will also be
   associated explicitly with that region. These associations are achieved by
   embedding appropriate number list and ROI description boxes in the JPX file
   (when you save the edited result).
</p>
<p>
   You may alter any of the above associations within the metadata editing
   dialog. The editor explicitly excludes options which are illegal; for example,
   metadata associated with a focus region must also be associated with at least
   one codestream, not just with compositing layers. You will see that you can
   add multiple associations, but it is up to you to ensure that this is
   meaningful.
</p>
<p>
   You can add descendant nodes to newly added metadata, via the "<em>Add
   child</em>" button, and navigate amongst the descendants you add in this way.
   For new metadata which is associated with a spatial region of interest, a
   label text node will automatically be added as a descendant, containing the
   initial string "<em>&lt;new label&gt;</em>". This is to remind you that
   regions of interest should probably have associated labels, and for backward
   compatibility with the much more limited editor provided with early versions
   of "<em>kdu_show</em>". However, you can always delete this descendant if you
   like.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Editing Existing Metadata</h2>
<p>
   When the metadata editor is opened, using any of the above methods, it is
   initialized with a restricted set of metadata nodes which are considered
   relevant for editing. You can modify, delete or add descendants to any of
   these nodes. If the editor was opened by right/ctrl-clicking a region of
   interest, displayed in the flashing or static overlay mode, only the ROI node
   and its descendants are included in the editing set. If the editor was opened
   by right/ctrl-clicking on any other part of the image view, the editing set
   consists of all metadata nodes which are associated with the image entities
   (codestreams or compositing layers) under the mouse cursor, plus all global
   metadata. You can navigate amongst these metadata nodes via the "<em>Previous
   sibling</em>" and "<em>Next sibling</em>" buttons.
</p>
<p>
   The metadata editor works closely with the catalog side-bar. The latter
   displays only labels and links (cross-references), but automatically updates
   (or pops up) in response to editing operations. At the top of the catalog
   side-bar is a "paste-bar" which can be used for copy/cut and paste operations.
   You can paste metadata directly into the catalog side-bar or within the
   metadata editor. If you paste something which has been cut (using "ctrl-X"
   resp. "cmd-X") it will be moved to the new location without altering any of
   the original contents or descendants; the original items will not be touched
   until they are actually pasted. Items can also be copied to the paste-bar as
   <em>links.</em> Links show up in the paste-bar in blue text with underlining;
   when pasted, they create a link to the original item within the metadata
   structure, rather than a copy of the item. This is extremely useful for
   building up semantic associations within the metadata. The "<em>kdu_show</em>"
   tool exploits links very extensively for navigation and discovering
   associations which can be used to determine which region-of-interest overlays
   to display when the "Metadata-&gt;Restrict overlays" option ("ctrl-R" resp.
   "cmd-R") is used.
</p>
<p>
   The metadata editor also provides a button for synchronizing the
   "<em>metashow</em>" window's contents with the metadata node currently being
   edited, so you can examine how the node is represented within the overall file
   structure. Of course, this is only possible for metadata nodes which are
   already present in the file structure, since the editor does not change the
   file structure until the file is actually saved. Similarly, for label
   metadata, there is also a button for synchronizing with the <em>catalog
   side-bar view</em>.
</p>
<p>
   The metadata editor has a lot of additional capabilities, which are either
   self explanatory or explained through tooltips which pop up when the mouse
   pointer hovers over interesting buttons.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Metadata Overlays</h2>
<p>
   Once you have some spatially associated metadata, you will notice that
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" highlights its presence via partially transparent
   overlays. You may use the Metadata menu to control the appearance of such
   overlays. Most usefully, the "ctrl-alt-T" (Mac: "cmd-alt-T") accelerator may
   be used to toggle the overlay mode between <em>flashing</em>, <em>static</em>,
   and <em>no overlays</em>. You may also control the lightness/heaviness of
   overlays via the Metadata menu. To declutter the overlay display, you can set
   the minimum size of elements which will appear on overlays (set the threshold
   via the Metadata menu) or you can use the "Restrict overlays to catalog
   selection" option in the "Metadata" menu (or via "ctrl-R" resp. "cmd-R").
</p>
<p>
   In the flashing or static overlay mode, whenever you left-click on an overlay
   region which is associated with a text label, the relevant entry will
   automatically be selected for you in the catalog side-bar. This is actually a
   more powerful feature than you might first imagine; where a region of interest
   is associated with multiple text labels, an algorithm attempts to select the
   most appropriate one in the catalog side-bar, based on recent navigation
   history, together with semantic associations formed by parent-child
   relationships and links. A nice way to construct multilingual metadata labels
   is to associate every region of interest with a "Grouping link" to a top-level
   index label which holds the name of the language (preferably written in the
   language of interest). Under each such Grouping link, add child labels to
   describe the metadata in the relevant language. If you do this, the automatic
   selection algorithm mentioned above, will automatically find the description
   of the clicked region of interest which uses the same language as the most
   recently selected item in the catalog side-bar.
</p>
<p>
   Right clicking on an overlay region opens up the metadata editor, as does left
   clicking with the ctrl key held down. You can do the same thing using the
   "ctrl-E" (Mac: "cmd-E") accelerator.
</p>
<p>
   It is possible to create a link directly to a region of interest (as opposed
   to a label which might describe the region of interest). To do this, use the
   "ctrl-L" (Mac: "cmd-L") accelerator (this generally copies metadata to the
   catalog paste-bar as links) while the mouse pointer is over the region of
   interest overlay within the image view. You need to be sure that the image
   view has keyboard focus, as opposed to the catalog side-bar -- you can do this
   by clicking anywhere in the image view first. If successful, your region of
   interest coordinates will be displayed in the catalog paste-bar using
   link-text conventions. You can then paste a link to the region of interest
   into the catalog side-bar (use "ctrl-V" or "cmd-V") or from within the
   metadata editor. These links show up within the catalog side-bar, enabling a
   user to navigate directly to the region of interest.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">The Catalog Side-bar</h2>
<p>
   When you open a JPX image with associated metadata in the form of text labels
   (JPX label boxes), an auxiliary catalog panel is automatically opened on the
   right hand side of the image view. The same thing happens when you first add
   such metadata to an image which previously had none. You can always hide the
   catalog panel via the Metadata menu (or "ctrl-shift-C" resp. "cmd-shift-C"
   accelerator), but it is very convenient to keep around. The catalog contains a
   hierarchically organized record of all textual metadata in the source, under
   three broad categories:
</p>
<dl class="description">
   <dt class="leadin">Index Labels:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         These correspond to text labels which are not descended (via a JPX "asoc" box
         hierarchy) from any "nlst" box (a <em>number-list</em> box identifies image
         entities, meaning codestreams, compositing layers, or the "rendered result" of
         a composition), nor found within any codestream or compositing layer header
         box. As such, index labels are not directly associated with any image entity,
         nor can they be associated with any region of interest, since regions of
         interest inherently belong to image entities.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         Despite their lack of any associations, index labels can be very useful for
         image navigation. This is because, you can always add links from any item in
         the index, where the target of the link can be another metadata item which
         does have image entity or region-of-interest associations. For example, you
         could build a geographical place name index, organized by counties, cities,
         suburbs, streets, etc., and then add links from entries in the index to
         region-of-interest associated metadata or just directly to the regions of
         interest. Clicking on the link within the metadata catalog, navigates the
         catalog to any associated label text while navigating the image view to the
         relevant region of interest, within the relevant image, compositing layer or
         composited result.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Image-Entity Labels</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         These correspond to text labels which are descended from an "nlst" box or
         found within a codestream header box or compositing layer header box, but not
         descended from an "roid" (region-of-interest description) box. These text
         labels are interpreted as being directly associated with whole image entities,
         as opposed to spatial regions within an image entity. Again, you can add links
         from such labels to other, region-specific metadata, if you like. However,
         this probably makes less sense that the use of cross-references within a
         top-level catalog, as described above.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Region-Specific Labels</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         These correspond to text labels which are descended from an "roid"
         (region-of-interest description) box. As such, they are directly associated
         with a specific spatial region of interest. As noted in the previous section,
         regions of interest must themselves be defined with respect to a codestream,
         but they may also be associated with compositing layers or a composited
         result, which contains the reference codestream (or codestreams). These
         associations are taken together, when interpreting the associated metadata and
         using it for navigating within the image view.
      </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Hierarchical Associations within the Catalog</h3>
<p>
   The catalog side-bar maintains the hierarchical association between its
   labels, as identified by the embedding of metadata within JPX "asoc" boxes.
   Extra levels in the hierarchy are inserted, if required, if the number of
   sibling labels encountered at any point grows too large to conveniently
   display within the catalog panel. This is done by introducing automatically
   creating alphabetical groupings. For example, the three sibling labels, "
   ants", "apples" and "Amazing Apes" might all be grouped under the heading
   "&lt;A..." if is deemed to be beneficial for user navigation within the
   catalog panel. These extra levels in the catalog hierarchy do not correspond
   to actual metadata -- they are introduced only for navigational convenience.
</p>
<p>
   It is worth mentioning that the catalog side-bar machinery updates itself
   automatically whenever metadata is added, deleted or modified via the metadata
   editor. The catalog side-bar also updates itself dynamically as more data
   arrives from a remote server, during remote image browsing via JPIP. All
   aspects of the catalog side-bar are dynamically adjusted, including the
   hierarchical association structure and the automatically generated summary
   groupings, such as "A..." for "ants", "apples" and "Amazing Apes". You can
   test this out yourself by adding a large number of metadata labels via the
   editor and watching what happens ... now try deleting some of the metadata
   again. The catalog side-bar does its best to keep the location of any selected
   items in the panel at the same location visually, regardless of how the
   structure changes around them. This is very important during JPIP image
   browsing, since the dynamic arrival of data from the server may frequently
   reconfigure the catalog -- but this is not annoying in practice, so long as
   the selected item always stays where it was.
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">Navigating with the Catalog</h3>
<p>
   Undoubtedly, the most useful feature of the metadata catalog is that it can be
   used to quickly navigate to associated imagery. All you have to do is double
   click any label in the catalog and the view window will adjust itself, if
   required, to show the associated codestream, compositing layer or animation
   frame, as appropriate. Moreover, for labels which are associated with spatial
   regions of interest, a focus box is automatically placed around the relevant
   spatial region's bounding box, and the view is panned and zoomed, as required,
   to make the region clearly visible.
</p>
<p>
   Once you have selected a label in the metadata catalog panel, you can use the
   Metadata menu or the "ctrl-E" (Mac: "cmd-E") accelerator to open that label
   within the metadata editor. You can also right-click or ctrl-left-click the
   item in the catalog as an even more convenient way to open the item in the
   metadata editor. For region-associated labels, the editor opens at the
   region-of-interest node ("roid" box) in which the label is embedded, since
   this is the place where you should modify the region's shape or image entity
   associations, if you wish to. You can always navigate to the label text via
   the editor's "<em>Descendants</em>" button.
</p>
<p>
   Navigation works in the reverse direction as well, taking you from a
   region-of-interest in the image view to associated metadata within the
   catalog, simply by clicking within the region's overlay in the image view.
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">Links and the Catalog</h3>
<p>
   As mentioned in the introduction to this section, it is useful to construct
   links from unnassociated (index) or less associated (image entity) metadata
   entries to region-specific metadata. It is also useful to create links from
   the highly associated metadata back to the less associated index data. Kakadu
   uses the terms <em>"Alternate-child link"</em> and <em>"Alternate-parent
   link"</em> to refer to these different type of links. While the associations
   are not strictly important, the semantic difference between these two types of
   links is the following: if a metadata item could meaningfully be included as a
   descendant the item which links to it, an alternate-child link should be used
   -- effectively, alternate-child links address the fact that metadata can often
   be meaningfully interpreted as descended from different parent items.
   Alternate-parent links provide a mechanism for the multiply descended child
   item to point back to its "virtual" parents.
</p>
<p>
   Building bi-directional links is particularly useful for remote image browsing
   via JPIP, since interactively following links sends the relevant metadata
   request commands to the JPIP server to fetch data which might not yet be
   available. For example, when accessing a small region of the image view, you
   may receive region-of-interest metadata from the server, which shows up as
   overlays on the image view. Clicking on the region-of-interest overlays, may
   reveal other associated metadata in the catalog side-bar (this should
   typically be the case in a well-constructed set of associated metadata). This,
   in turn, may contain links to other metadata (e.g., alternate parent
   associations within the metadata ontology) and following these links may take
   the interactive user to other categories of data from which new
   region-of-interest associations may be discovered. Double clicking
   region-of-interest associated metadata in the catalog adjusts the image view
   and causes new window-of-interest requests to be sent to the JPIP server; and
   so forth.
</p>
<p>
   Kakadu identifies a third type of semantic link relationship, which we term a
   "<em>Grouping link.</em>" Unlike Alternate-child and Alternate-parent links,
   grouping links are simultaneously links to other metadata in the catalog and
   parents (or branches) within the metadata hierarchy -- i.e., they can have
   descendants. Semantically, all the descendants of a grouping link can be
   interpreted as members of the same group as the descendants of any other
   grouping link which has the same link target. You can use grouping links in
   lots of ways, but one important example is language groups. To construct
   language groups, first create a label in the index category (i.e., an
   unassociated label) for each language you are interested in (e.g., "English",
   "French", "Japanese", etc.). Then whenever you want to create a multi-lingual
   set of associated metadata for some entity (e.g., a region-of-interest), add a
   grouping link to each language in question under the entity you want to
   describe and then add the language-specific descriptive metadata under each
   such grouping link. This works beautifully in "<em>kdu_show</em>", for all
   kinds of navigational purposes. You will find that clicking the entity in
   question (e.g., a region-of-interest) takes you to the most appropriate
   description in the catalog, depending on the language most recently selected
   by the user.
</p>
<p>
   To help you work with these different types of link semantics, the catalog
   side-bar colour-codes them differently and even adds suggestive arrows to the
   link text (the arrows won't show up on Windows XP unfortunately). To add links
   to the existing metadata, you first copy the link target to the catalog
   paste-bar as a link -- use the Metadata catalog or the "ctrl-L" (Mac: "cmd-L")
   accelerator -- and then paste the link to the location of interest. When you
   do so, a dialog box will appear to ask you what type of link you want to add;
   this dialog box contains its own explanation of the different types of links,
   so you don't have to remember everything you read here.
</p>
<h1 class="section">Saving Files</h1>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>s</sub>aving"></a>
</p>
<p>
   You may save images back out of "<em>kdu_show</em>" via the File menu options.
   This is of interest particularly if you have edited an image's metadata, or if
   the image has been obtained from a remote JPIP server -- in that case, the
   saved file will contain whatever information has been received from the server
   up to the point when it is saved.
</p>
<p>
   You may edit and resave a file over the top of the file you already have open.
   In this case, however, the file is actually saved under a different name,
   formed by appending the "~" character to the name of the currently open file,
   rather than overwriting it. When you close the open file, any such saved copy
   is automatically renamed so as to replace the one you had open. This happens
   even if you close the application (e.g., by hitting the "ctrl-Q" resp. "cmd-Q"
   accelerator). The File menu provides a convenient "Save and Reload" option,
   which combines the above operations of saving over the current file and then
   re-opening it.
</p>
<p>
   You can save files as raw codestreams (choose a suffix of ".j2c" or ".j2k"),
   simple JP2 files (choose a suffix of ".jp2") or JPX files (choose a suffix of
   ".jpx" or ".jpf"). If you are currently viewing a motion JPEG2000 file (MJ2),
   you can save current frame as a JP2 file or a raw codestream, but you cannot
   currently save the entire movie.
</p>
<p>
   The File menu provides two additional variations on the "Save As" option,
   which enable you to force the use of external links to the codestreams or
   force the embedding of codestreams in the saved file. In most cases, all
   relevant codestreams are already embedded in the images you open with
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" and the "Save As" option retains this embedding. However,
   JPX files can contain links to codestreams which may be found in other files;
   the "Save As" option preserves such links rather than embedding the
   codestreams. "Save As Linked" forces the use of links, meaning that
   codestreams which are currently embedded in the file you have open will be
   recorded as links into that file. Linked codestreams are very useful while you
   are editing metadata for a very large image or collection of images, since
   each time you save your results, only the metadata structure need actually be
   written to disk. Of course, with linked codestreams you have to be careful not
   to delete or overwrite the file which contains the linked codestreams.
</p>
<p>
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" does its best to keep track of links into any of the files
   it has open and prevent you from saving over any of those files, but it can't
   be aware of files it does not have open.
