                                 kdws_frame_window *wnd);
    /* This function is used when a window (identified by `wnd') needs to
       open a JPIP connection to an image on a remote server.  The first thing
       to understand is that when multiple windows want to access the same
       remote image, it is much more efficient for them to share a single cache
       and a single `kdu_client' object, opening multiple request queues
       within the client.  Where possible, this translates into the client
       opening multiple parallel JPIP channels to the server.  To facilitate
       this, the `kdu_client' object is not created within the window (or its
       associated `kdws_renderer' object), but within the present function.
       If a client already exists which has an alive connection to the server
       for the same resource, the function returns a reference to the existing
       `client' to which it has opened a new request queue, whose id is
       returned via `request_queue_id' -- this is the value supplied in calls
       to `kdu_client::post_window' and `kdu_client::disconnect' amongst other
       member functions.
       [//]
       In the special case of a one-time request, the function allows any
       number of windows to associate themselves with the client, returning
       a `request_queue_id' value of 0 in every case, as if each of them
       were the one which originally called `kdu_client::connect'.  This
       is fine because none of them are allowed to alter the window of
       interest for clients opened with a one-time request.
       [//]
       The remote image can be identified either through a non-NULL
       `url' string, or through non-NULL `server' and `request' strings.
       In the former case, the server name and request component's of the
       URL are separated by the function.  In either case, the function
       returns a reference to an internally created URL string, which could
       be used as the `url' in a future call to this function to retain the
       same client again, opening another request queue on it.  The returned
       string is usually also employed as the window's title.  This string
       remains valid until the retain count for the JPIP client reaches zero
       (through matching calls to `release_jpip_client'), at which point the
       client is closed and deleted.
       [//]
       The present function also arranges for a `kdu_client_notifier'
       object to be created and associated with the client, which in turn
       arranges for a `client_notification' message to be sent to `wnd'
       whenever the client has something to notify the application about.
       If multiple windows are sharing the same client, they will all receive
       notification messages.  The `client_notification' messages are
       delivered (asynchonously) within the application's main thread, even
       through they are generated from within the client's separate
       network management thread.
       [//]
       Note that this function may indirectly generate an error through
       `kdu_error' if there is something wrong with the `server',
       `request' or `url' arguments, so the caller needs to be prepared to
       catch the resulting integer exception.

       of windows using the client drops to 0; in this case a much smaller
