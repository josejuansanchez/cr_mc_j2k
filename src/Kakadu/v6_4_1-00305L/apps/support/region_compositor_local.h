  /* Notes:
       Overlay information is segmented into fixed size segments, which are
     aligned absolutely on the compositing reference grid, so that segments
     occupy corresponding positions across all overlay buffers in a composition.
       Each such segment corresponds to a single reference in the
     `kdrc_overlay::seg_refs' array, and each such reference points to a
     linked list of `kdrc_overlay_segment' objects.
       At present, each reference in the `kdrc_overlay::seg_refs' array
     points to a single `kdrc_overlay_segment'.  However, in the future, we
     may allow for lists of `kdrc_overlay_segment' records, each spanning a
     smaller region.  The implementation is partially prepared for this
     eventuality.
       If `first_unpainted' is NULL, the segment's overlay information has
     been entirely painted.
       The `needs_process' member is true if the segment has not yet been
     processed by `kdrc_overlay::process'.  A segment which has a non-NULL
     `first_unpainted' member necessarily has `needs_process' equal to true;
     however, we also mark segments with `needs_process' equal to true if
     they have been recently erased within `kdrc_overlay::update_config',
     since the erased state is only communicated to the compositing logic
     in response to the information returned by `kdrc_overlay::process'. */

  /* Notes: This object is used by the `kdu_region_compositor::paint_overlays'
     function to paint quadrilaterals.  Specifically, the function is used to
     paint the lines between two bounding edges -- a left edge and a right
     edge.  This means that the function paints trapezoids, whose parallel
     edges are horizontal.
       The idea is that trapezoids will be painted row by row and this
     function is used to discover the left and right edges of each row.  To
     avoid gaps due to edges with high gradients, `x1' and `x2' boundaries
     are based on 3 quantities: x_c is the horizontal coordinate at the
     centre of the line; x_t is the horizontal coordinate at the top of the
     line; and x_b is the horizontal coordinate at the bottom of the line.
     Then the left edge is set to x1 = min{x1_c,x1_t+0.5,x1_b+0.5}, while
     the right edge is set to x2 = max{x2_c,x2_t-0.5,x2_b-0.5}.  This
     policy needs to be modified slightly at the vertices which define the
     edges of line segments, so as to exclude the contribution of
     x_t at the top and x_b at the bottom vertex.  To accommodate this,
     the `init' function sets up `inc1' and `inc2' to hold the amount by
     which `x1' and `x2' must be changed on the next line only; to be
     replaced by `next_inc1' and `next_inc2' on all subsequent lines, except
     the last (`y'=`y_end') for which `end_inc1' and `end_inc2' are to be
     used. */

         The arguments may be interpreted in terms of a mapping from the
         coordinates used by ROI description boxes to the corresponding
         coordinates on the compositing reference grid.  Let `R' denote
         an object of the `kdu_dims' class, corresponding to an ROI
         description region.  The following steps will map `R' to a
         region on the compositing reference grid:
            1) Add `image_offset' to `R'.pos.  This translates the region
               to one which is correctly registered against the codestream's
               high resolution canvas.
            2) Divide the starting (inclusive) and ending (exclusive)
               coordinates of the region by `subsampling', rounding all
               coordinates up.
            3) Apply `kdu_dims::to_apparent', supplying the `transpose',
               `vflip' and `hflip' parameters.
            4) Multiply the coordinates by `expansion_numerator' over
               `expansion_denominator'.
            5) Subtract `compositing_offset'.
         [//]
         The final argument supplies the index of the compositing layer
         associated with the owning `kdrc_stream' object -- may be -1 if
         the stream is being used to display raw codestream data only.  This
         is useful in determining which regions of interest should be

     an overlay surface buffer is required, it has exactly the same dimensions

     directly.  Instead, it invokes virtual functions of the `compositor'

     overlay painting process, providing graphical effects which are most
     appropriate for exploiting application-specific metadata. */

      /* Called after initialization and whenever the image is zoomed,
         rotated, etc.  After a call to this function, `set_buffer_surface'
         must also be called.
           `full_target_dims' identifies the location and size of the full
         image region as it would appear on the compositing grid at
         full size, without any transposition, rotation or scaling.  If the
         size of this region is 0, it will automatically be assigned
         the same size as `full_source_dims', after first assigning a default
         size for `full_source_dims' (if it is zero on entry) in the manner
         described below.
            After an initially empty `full_target_dims' is assigned the same
         size as `full_source_dims', the location of the default target
         region is assigned based upon the values found in
         `full_target_dims.pos' on entry.  Specifically, if
         `full_target_dims.pos.x' is zero on entry, the default assigned target
         region is also anchored at x=0; otherwise it is anchored at
         1-`full_target_dims.size.x' so that the right edge of the assigned
         target region is aligned at x=0.  The same policy is used to align
         the vertical edge of an assigned target region with y=0 at the top
         or bottom, depending on whether `full_target_dims.pos.y' was zero
         or not on entry.  This alignment policy is required to ensure that
         the default assigned target region would have its top-left corner
         anchored at the origin if interpreted after the application of
         "imagery layer"-specific orientation flags passed to
         `kdu_region_compositor::add_ilayer' and related functions.
            `full_source_dims' identifies the location and size of the complete
         source region to be used in generating the target image region.  This
         region is expressed relative to the source image (i.e., current
         code-stream image) upper left hand corner, but at a scale in which
         each code-stream canvas grid point occupies
         `source_sampling.x'/`source_denominator.x' horizontal source grid
         points and `source_sampling.y'/`source_denominator.y' vertical source
         grid points.  These sampling factors are normally both equal to 1,
         unless the code-stream is used by a JPX compositing layer whose
         embedded code-stream registration box specifies non-trivial sampling
         factors.
            If `full_source_dims' has zero size, it will automatically be
         set to the full canvas dimensions of the current source image,
         scaled up by the sampling factors given by `source_sampling' and
         `source_denominator'.  For MJ2 sources, the `full_source_dims'
         argument is always treated as if it were empty on entry.
            Note carefully that none of the `full_source_dims',
         `full_target_dims', `source_sampling' or `source_denominator'
         arguments are sensitive to the effects of image re-orientation and
         dynamic scaling, so their values will be the same each time this
         function is called, regardless of the values taken by the remaining
         arguments.
           In the special case where the object is in single component mode
         or it was initialized with a raw codestream (as opposed to a JPX
         stream interface or an MJ2 track), the source dimensions (as
         operated on by `full_source_dims', `source_sampling' and
         `source_denominator') are interpreted using the resolution of the
         first colour channel's image component, as opposed to the
         high resolution codestream canvas -- these are the same only if
         the first colour channel has sub-sampling factors of (1,1).
           `vflip, `hflip' and `transpose' identify additional geometric
         transformations which are to be applied on the compositing grid.
           `scale' represents the amount by which the full target dimensions
         are to be stretched or shrunk down during the rendering process.
           The function attempts to approximate the required scaling
         transformations by a reasonable combination of resolution level
         discarding and resampling.  It returns the actual location and
         dimensions of the region which can be painted on the compositing
         grid, accounting for all geometric changes associated with the
         last four arguments.
           If the requested scale is too small, too large, or the required
         flipping cannot be performed, the function returns an empty region,
         identifying the specific problem by setting one or more flags in
         the `invalid_scale_code' argument.  */

  /* Notes:
       This object provides the internal representation for what is known
     as an "istream" within the documentation of `kdu_region_compositor'.
     Multiple istreams can share a single codestream, which is managed via
     the `codestream' interface.  Every "istream" necessarily belongs to
     exactly one "ilayer", which is represented internally by `kdrc_layer'.
       All istreams belong to a single `streams' list managed by the
     `owner' object.  Every istream is also attached to exactly one
     `kdrc_layer' object (i.e., `layer' is never NULL).  Those which are
     attached to active layers have their `is_active' member true, while
     those attached to inactive layers have their `is_active' member false.
       To understand the way this object works, you must first understand that
     there are several coordinate systems at work simultaneously:
     1) There is one global "compositing grid".  Most coordinates passed
        across this object's functions are expressed in terms of the global
        compositing grid.
     2) Each codestream has its own "rendering grid" whose scale matches that
        of the compositing grid, but the origin of the codestream's rendering
        grid is displaced relative to that of the compositing grid by the
        amount stored in the `compositing_offset' member.  Most internal
        coordinates are expressed in terms of the rendering grid.  The
        interpretation of the rendering grid is exactly the same as that
        adopted by the `kdu_region_decompressor' object.
     3) Each codestream has its own high-resolution canvas against which
        all component samples are registered.  The dimensions of the canvas
        are fixed, while those of the compositing and rendering grids change
        as a function of zoom and rotation parameters.  The rendering
        grid is related to the codestream canvas as follows.  We first find
        the dimensions of the reference component after any discarded
        resolution levels have been taken into account; these dimensions
        are related to those of the high-res canvas by sub-sampling by the
        relevant component sub-sampling factors and the number of discarded
        DWT levels.  We apply any required rotation/flipping to these
        dimensions and then expand by the factors stored in the `expansion'
        member.
       The `rendering_dims' region represents the portion of the code-stream
     image (expressed on the rendering grid) which is to be used for
     compositing.  In most cases, this will be the entire image, but
     some compositing rules use a cropped version of the image.
       The `active_region' represents the portion of the `rendering_dims'
     region which lies on the current buffer surface.  This is also
     expressed with respect to the rendering grid.
       The `valid_region' member identifies the subset of `active_region'
     for which image samples are known to have been generated.
       If this object was originally initialized using an MJ2 or JPX file
     format specification (i.e., not for raw codestream access), the
     `colour_init_src' member is set to identify the JPX compositing
     layer index or the MJ2 track index (zero based) from which the
     colour description, channel bindings and related information were
     retrieved during initialization.  Otherwise, this member is set to -1.
     It is possible for an object to be initialized with valid file format
     specifications (i.e., non-negative `colour_init_src') but subsequently
     to be put into single component mode via `set_mode'.  The object can be
     returned to its original use for disciplined colour rendering, so long
     as the `colour_init_src' member is consistent with the intended purpose.

            If one or more of the required codestream main headers is not

         on the layer's own reference grid, relative to the upper left hand
         corner of the layer image on that grid.  The layer reference grid
         is often identical to the high resolution canvas of its code-stream
         (or code-streams).  More generally, however, the layer reference
         grid is related to the code-stream canvas grids by the information
         returned via `jpx_layer_source::get_codestream_registration'.
            The `full_target_dims' argument identifies the region of the
         composited image onto which the source region should be composited
         (scaling may be involved).  These coordinates are expressed relative
         to the compositing reference grid which would be used if the

         flipping or transposition. */

  /* Notes:
          This object provides the internal information for what is known
       as an "imagery layer" (or "ilayer") to users of the
       `kdu_region_compositor' object.
          Each ilayer is served by at most two "istreams" (represented by
       `kdrc_stream' objects).  The `main_stream' object manages the colour
       channels and, if possible, alpha information.  The `aux_stream' object
       manages alpha information, if it is not already available from the
       `main_stream' object.  In the future, we may provide for up to four
       separate codestreams (one per colour channel) but this would require
       colour transformations to be implemented here, rather than in the
       underlying `kdu_region_decompressor' workhorse, which supports only
       one codestream.
          Each code-stream may have its own sub-sampling factors relating
       its canvas coordinates to those of a layer reference grid.  In fact,
       these sampling factors may be rational valued, being equal to the
       ratio between the `main_stream_sampling' and `main_stream_denominator'
       coordinates, or the `aux_stream_sampling' and `aux_stream_denominator'
       coordinates, as appropriate.  In many cases, however, the layer
       reference grid is identical to the high resolution canvas of one or
       both code-streams.  The sub-sampling factors indicate the number of
       layer grid points between each pair of canvas grid points.
          The `full_source_dims' member identifies the portion of the source
       image which is actually to be composited.  The coordinates
       are expressed, independent of any rotation or zooming factors, relative
       to the upper left hand corner of the image, as it appears on the layer
       grid (see above for the relationship between the layer grid and the
       high resolution canvas associated with each codestream).
          The `full_target_dims' member identifies the region of the composited
       image onto which the above source region is to be composited.  This
       region is expressed relative to the compositing grid which would be
       used if there were no scaling and no rotation.
          The `mj2_pending_frame_change' flag is true if the frame(s)
       represented by the current `streams' object(s) are not the correct ones.
       When a frame change is requested, but the required frames are not
       currently available from an MJ2 video source (not yet available in the
       dynamic cache), we leave the streams pointing to the codestreams
       associated with a previous frame so as not to interrupt video playback.
       However, each time `set_scale' or `kdu_region_compositor::refresh' is
       called, an attempt will be made to open the correct frame if it has
       since become available.  This is done using the `change_frame' function.
          The `layer_region' member identifies the full extent of the
       composited image region associated with this ilayer, expressed
       relative to the compositing grid, at the current scale and accounting
       for any rotation, flipping or transposition.
          The `layer_buffer_region' is always a subset of `layer_region'.  It
       identifies the region on the compositing grid which is currently
       buffered within the `layer_buffer'.
          The `compositing_buffer_region' member is ignored unless
       `compositing_buffer' is non-NULL.  In this case, imagery from this
       layer is to be composited onto the `compositing_buffer' when the
       `perform_composition' function is called.  The region occupied by the
       compositing buffer is also expressed relative to the compositing grid,
       but may be larger (no smaller) than the current `layer_buffer_region'.
       This is because some layers may occupy only a portion of the composited
       image. */
