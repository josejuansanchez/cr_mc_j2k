This object is used to interact with an internal metadata
tree, which is created to reflect the associations
between metadata in a JPX file. By metadata, here we
mean all of the box types described in connection with
the 
<A HREF="jpx$nager__set$ox_filter.html">jpx_meta_manager::set_box_filter</A> function, plus any association (
<B>asoc</B>) boxes and the first sub-box of any association box.
Boxes which are not represented by this object are
those which are directly related to rendering the compressed
imagery. Typical examples of boxes managed by the object
are XML boxes, number list boxes, label boxes, ROI
description boxes, UUID boxes, IP-rights boxes and
Cross-Reference boxes.
</P><P>
 Each intermediate node in the tree (i.e. everything
other than the root and the leaves) corresponds to
an association relationship, which could be represented
using a JPX association (
<B>asoc</B>) box. In some cases, the relationship might be represented
by some other means, such as inclusion of the relevant
metadata within a codestream header or compositing
layer header box, but it is easiest to understand the
tree structure by assuming that each intermediate node
corresponds to exactly one association box. The first
sub-box of an association box plays a special role,
describing an entity to which all subsequent sub-boxes
are to be associated. These subsequent sub-boxes are
represented by the node's descendants (branches in
the tree), while the contents of the first box are
considered to belong to the node itself.
</P><P>
 In cases where the first sub-box of an association
is itself an association box, it is unclear exactly
what association was intended. For this reason, we
do not include the first sub-box of an association
amongst the descendants of a node. All other sub-boxes
are treated as descendants (branches) whose nodes may
be further split if they contain association boxes.
</P><P>
 There are two important cases for the first sub-box
of an association box, as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
If the first sub-box of an association is a number
list (
<B>nlst</B>) box, all descendants of the node are associated with
the image entities listed in the number list box. These
entities may be codestreams, compositing layers, or
the entire composited image.
</LI><LI>
If the first sub-box of an association is an ROI description
(
<B>roid</B>) box, all descendants of the node are associated with
the rectangular and/or elliptical regions described
by that box.
</LI></UL><P>
 The above two special cases are represented explicitly
and the association parameters may be explicitly created
and retrieved via the various member functions offered
by the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> interface.
</P><P>
 As mentioned previously, the associations embodied
by an intermediate node in the metadata tree might
not necessarily arise from the appearance of an 
<B>asoc</B> box within the JPX file. In particular, wherever any
of the metadata boxes mentioned above appears within
a codestream header or a compositing layer header box,
the metadata will be treated as though it had been
contained within an 
<B>asoc</B> box whose first sub-box was a number list box which
referenced the relevant codestream or compositing layer.
When the information in a 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> tree is used to write a new JPX file, however, all
associations will be formed using 
<B>asoc</B> boxes, rather than by inclusion within codestream
header or compositing layer header boxes.
</P><P>
 Leaves in the tree have no descendants. A leaf node
represents a single JP2 box, which is not further divided
through the use of 
<B>asoc</B> boxes.
</P><P>
 In the above, we have described intermediate nodes
and leaf nodes. The one additional type of node is
the tree root, to which access is granted using 
<A HREF="jpx$nager__access_root.html">jpx_meta_manager::access_root</A>. All descendants of the root node correspond to metadata
which (at least notionally) resides at the top level
of the file. Whereas intermediate nodes have their
own box, which corresponds to the first sub-box of
an association box (whether real or implied), the root
node has no box of its own; it has only descendants
and its box-type is returned as 0.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> interface is designed to meet the needs of file readers
and file writers, including incremental file parsers,
which may be accessing a JPX data source which is being
supplied by a dynamic cache whose contents are written
in some arbitrary order by a remote JPIP server. Both
reading and writing functions may be used together
to interactively edit an existing metadata tree. For
this reason, provision is made to read boxes which
are described by any of the methods allowed during
writing, including boxes which are described by reference
to an existing node (possibly in another metadata tree)
and boxes which are described by placeholders which
are used to defer box generation until the file is
actually being written.
</P><P>
 For the added convenience of incremental readers,
editors and other interesting applications which may
interact with JP2/JPX metadata, the 
<A HREF="jpx$nager.html">jpx_meta_manager</A> object provides methods for retrieving metanodes based
on the file address of their constituent boxes, for
enumerating metanodes based on their association with
image entities and/or regions of interest, and for
efficiently scanning through metanodes which have been
recently parsed from the data source or changed by
editing operations. Furthermore, the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> interface provides methods for identifying whether
a node has been changed by editing operations and for
saving an application-defined pointer (usually a pointer
into some data structure maintained by the application).
Together, these features can be used to efficiently
track changes in the metadata structure due to editing
or incremental reading of a data source (typically,
as it becomes available from a dynamic cache).
</P><P>
 From version 6.2, Kakadu also provides extensive support
for discovery, creating, copying and writing metadata
links. A metadata link is represented in the JPX file
using a cross-reference box, which points to the contents
of another box. Cross-reference boxes may potentially
be used for many things and in many ways, but Kakadu
exploits them to represent links between nodes in the
metadata tree, allowing for the construction of arbitrary
graphs. The most natural interpretation of a cross-reference
box which points to another box is that the referenced
box should be treated as though it appeared in place
of the cross-reference box. Keeping this in mind, if
a cross-reference box points to an 
<B>asoc</B> box, Kakadu treats the cross-reference as a link to
the entire sub-tree embedded within that asoc box &mdash;
such links are termed "Alternate Child" links and assigned
a 
<B>jpx_metanode_link_type</B> of 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK</A>. Cross-references which point to leaves in the metadata
tree (i.e., to non-asoc boxes which are not the first
sub-box of an asoc box) are also interpreted as "Alternate
Child" links. Applications may choose to follow alternate
child links to the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> to which they point, interpreting that node and all
its descendants as though they were additional descendants
of the node in which the link (i.e., the cross-reference)
is found.
</P><P>
 Kakadu also defines two other types of cross-reference
linking relationships, known as "Grouping links" and
"Alternate Parent" links, whose semantics are useful
in constructing metadata graphs. Although the interpretation
of internal cross-references is not made clear in the
standard itself, Kakadu's interpretations and usage
are natural and intuitive. For more information on
links and link types, see the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html">get_link</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__add_link.html">add_link</A> member functions, as well as the powerful graph parsing
function, 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__find_path_to.html">find_path_to</A>.
</P><P>
 Note carefully that objects of the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> class are merely interfaces to an internal object,
which cannot be directly created by an application.
Use the member functions offered by 
<A HREF="jpx$nager.html">jpx_meta_manager</A> to obtain a non-empty interface.
